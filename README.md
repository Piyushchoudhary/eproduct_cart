## E-Product Cart

The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store
where any e-product (such as pdf, docs, csv, ppt etc.) can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet.

However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online e-commerce store.
An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the
catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping
cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At
that time, user need to verify by using Twillio Authy for 2-factor authentication. An e-mail is
sent to the customer as soon as the order is placed with e-product as attachment.
